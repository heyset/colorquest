# ColorQuest

ColorQuest is a color guessing game where you are presented with a code (RGB or Hex) and five choices that are close to each other, then you have to guess which one is the correct.

You can try it out at https://colorquest.me :)

It's super fun! (and harder than I initially thought it would be lol)

## Tech and stuff

The game was created solo by me over the course of a few weeks.

It uses NextJS and TypeScript as the main techs, and good ol' CSS Modules for the styles.

It has _very few_ dependencies, as I tried to do most of the things by hand in order to hone my skills.

You can check out the initial wireframe I created [here at this Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/iqWo480mxhnz6VUg7MeIpZ/ColorQuest?node-id=0%3A1) and also the leveling curve calculation on [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wpol2O7mj9zzlGUmCkd9_iWpoKJK45qvUaX1wRT2voY/edit?usp=sharing).
